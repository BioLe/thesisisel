\acknowledgements

I would like to express my genuine gratitude to all that contributed directly or indirectly to the development of this dissertation.

To my advisors, Nuno Cruz and Nuno Datia, I would like to thank them for the support in the development of the project that I proposed, while always being available to help no matter the time of day and providing continuous constructive feedback throughout the dissertation.

Also would like to thank ISEL and Pedro Jorge, for offering me a job opportunity as a Teacher's Assistant, which allowed me to continue my studies and get to this point.

Finally, a special thanks to my family, who have blindly supported my education and always believed in me, and to my girlfriend for always keeping me motivated.
