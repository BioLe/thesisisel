The dissertation must contain two versions of the abstract, one in the same language as the main text, another in a different language.  The package assumes the two languages under consideration are always Portuguese and English. The package will sort the abstracts in the proper order. 

The abstract is critical because many researchers will read only that part. Your abstract should provide an accurate and sufficiently detailed summary of your work so that readers will understand what you did, why you did it, what your findings are, and why your findings are useful and important. The abstract must be able to stand alone as an overview of your study that can be understood without reading the entire text. However, your abstract should not be overly detailed. For example, it does not need to include a detailed methods section.

The abstract should not contain bibliography citations, tables, charts or diagrams. Give preference to the use of the verbs in the third person singular. Time and word must not dissociate yourself within the abstract. Abbreviations should be limited. 

Finally, you must avoid the use of expressions such as "The present work deals with ... ", "In this thesis are discussed .... ", "The document concludes that .... ", "apparently and .... " etc.

Abstracts are usually followed by a list of keywords selected by the author. Choosing appropriate keywords is important, because these are used for indexing purposes. Well-chosen keywords enable your manuscript to be more easily identified and cited.
